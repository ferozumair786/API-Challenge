# API-Challenge
Homework for UT Data Science Bootcamp focused on use of API tools

Observations:
1. There is a quadratic correlation between the latitude and max temp because the earth is round and max temperature peaks closest to the equator. 
2. There really isn't any correlation between any of the other values with latitude
3. You might think that the humidity will be higher closer to the equator, but there are also deserts around the equator
